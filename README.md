This Github (SangeetSatpathy) has private code from exercises, labs and assignments from the following Foothill College courses:

CS1A (Object-Oriented Methodologies in Java) <br>
CS1B (Intermediate Software Design in Java) <br>
CS2A (Object-Oriented Methodologies in C++) <br>
CS3A (Object-Oriented Methodologies in Python) <br>

CS22A (Javascript for Programmers) <br>

## CS1A (Object-Oriented Methodologies in Java) Assignments
In this course, we learned OOP in Java through the use of a robot simulator.
### Assignment 1: Making New Robot Classes with New Methods
Makes a robot walk down a set of given "walls" in the simulator by definining and using functions.

### Assignment 2: Advanced Robots
Utilizes loops to make the robot run a course and pick up "points" at the end of each part of the course.

### Assignment 3: Robot Maze
A program that lets the robot run any solvable maze.

### Assignment 4: Guessing Game
A game that prompts the user to guess a number between -64 to 64. The program keeps repeating till the user guesses the right number or they run out of their 7 allowed attempts, notifying them each time whether the number is larger or smaller than the guessed number.

### Assignment 5: Graphical User Interfaces and Events
A simple applet to display different movie posters which the user can choose from in a drop-down menu, utilizing JavaFX.

## CS2A (Object-Oriented Methodologies in C++)
This course served as an introduction to C++ and its various features.
### Assignment 1:
Part 1: Formatting and printing outputs <br>
Part 2: storing variables.
### Assignment 2:
Part 1: Simple program that asks the user for a number of cents and calculates the number of each coin that would be required (assuming the smallest number of coins is preferred). <br>
Part 2: A program that converts an inputted Celsius value into Fahrenheit. <br>
Part 3: Practice with various string functions in C++.
### Assignment 3:
Part 1: A simple program which calculates the area of either a triangle or square. The user is asked if the shape they want is a triangle or square, then accordingly asks them for inputs and calculates the area. <br>
Part 2: This program asks the user for the number of years of school they have been in. It then utilizes if-else statements to print out the school level they are in. <br>
Part 3: This program serves as a basic calculator. It asks the user for a number, then the operator, then a second number.
It then prints out the answer, rounded to 2 decimal places. <br>
Part 4: This program calculates the cost of calls made, depending on the start time of the call and its duration. It also takes into account a tax, which is assumed to be 4%.
### Assignment 4:
Part 1: This program is a revision of the program in Assignment 1, which converts pounds to ounces. However, it will ask the user after every conversion whether they have another value they would like to convert. <br>
Part 2: This program is a revision of the program in Assignment 1, which converts pounds to ounces. However, it will keep prompting the user to input a pound value until they enter a negative value, which exits the program. <br>
Part 3: This program accounts for the ages of several attendees to an event. Each attendee's age and
food preference (choices being popcorn, soda, or both) are recorded. The program then counts and prints the number
of attendees in each age group, the average age (rounded to the tenth place), the oldest person, the youngest
person, and the number of attendees who prefer each food preference.
