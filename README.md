This Github (SangeetSatpathy) has private code from exercises, labs and assignments from the following Foothill College courses:

CS1A (Object-Oriented Methodologies in Java) <br>
CS1B (Intermediate Software Design in Java) <br>
CS2A (Object-Oriented Methodologies in C++) <br>
CS3A (Object-Oriented Methodologies in Python) <br>
CS3B (Intermediate Software Design in Python) <br>
CS22A (Javascript for Programmers) <br>

## CS1A (Object-Oriented Methodologies in Java) Assignments
In this course, we learned OOP in Java through the use of a robot simulator.
### Assignment 1: Making New Robot Classes with New Methods
Makes a robot walk down a set of given "walls" in the simulator by definining and using functions.

### Assignment 2: Advanced Robots
Utilizes loops to make the robot run a course and pick up "points" at the end of each part of the course.

### Assignment 3: Robot Maze
A program that lets the robot run any solvable maze.

### Assignment 4: Guessing Game
A game that prompts the user to guess a number between -64 to 64. The program keeps repeating till the user guesses the right number or they run out of their 7 allowed attempts, notifying them each time whether the number is larger or smaller than the guessed number.

### Assignment 5: Graphical User Interfaces and Events
A simple applet to display different movie posters which the user can choose from in a drop-down menu, utilizing JavaFX.

## CS2A (Object-Oriented Methodologies in C++)
This course served as an introduction to C++ and its various features.
### Assignment 1:
Part 1: Formatting and printing outputs <br>
Part 2: storing variables.
### Assignment 2:
Part 1: Simple program that asks the user for a number of cents and calculates the number of each coin that would be required (assuming the smallest number of coins is preferred).
Part 2: A program that converts an inputted Celsius value into Fahrenheit.
Part 3: Practice with various string functions in C++.
